# Hello, World!
My name is Terri.  :jp: :us:

![Matrix gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/sULKEgDMX8LcI/giphy.gif) 

I'm self-studying **programming, OSINT, ethical hacking, and penetration testing**. Currently I'm learning **Javascript** and the **Python** programming language.
I'm interested in doing bug bounties and also freelance private investigations using OSINT techniques. Also, I'd like to learn how to make **GUIs** for different programs and scripts that are currently only available to use in the terminal here on Github.

:floppy_disk: Another interest of mine is data archiving ("digital hoarding"). I want to learn web scraping using Python and write software/tools that aid in web scraping and archiving. So all-in-all, I'd like to focus on Python and become proficient at it. :floppy_disk:

I'm an idea person.  :thought_balloon:  :thought_balloon:  :thought_balloon: I have tons of ideas (notebooks filled with ideas). I imagine working with others remotely through Github to create tools that others will find useful and enjoy.

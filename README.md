# Hello, World!

## Who am I? Why am I here?
My name is Terri.  :jp: :us:

I'm self-studying **OSINT, hacking, penetration testing, and programming**. Currently I'm learning the **Python** programming language.
I'm interested in doing bug bounties and also freelance private investigations using OSINT techniques.
Also, I'd like to learn how to make **GUIs** for different programs and scripts that are currently only available to use in the terminal here on Github.

:floppy_disk: Another interest of mine is archiving ("digital hoarding"). I want to learn web scraping using Python and write software/tools that have something to do with web scraping and archiving. :floppy_disk:

:books: I love to learn. I'm a writer and I love taking tons of notes. :pencil:

I'm an idea person.  :thought_balloon:  :thought_balloon:  :thought_balloon: I have tons of ideas (notebooks filled with ideas). I imagine working with others remotely through Github to create tools that others will find useful and enjoy.

## My Plans for Github
[ ] edit other users' work where possible (ie. participate)

[ ] write and post helpful articles (as repositories)

[ ] figure out how to get my ideas implemented (Projects? Gists?)

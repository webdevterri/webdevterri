# Hello, World!
My name is Terri. I go by **webdevterri**.
## What I'm up to
I'm currently working as a Data Annotator (training AI models.)
## Who am I?
I'm an idea person.  :thought_balloon:  :thought_balloon:  :thought_balloon: I have tons of ideas (notebooks filled with ideas). I imagine working with others remotely, thanks to the wonderful invention of the internet, to create tools that others will find useful and enjoy.

<!-- ### Goals & Interests:

#### Using JavaScript
I want to create utility apps and browser extensions.

Also, I like to build websites. I've made many WordPress sites but I'm in the process of moving away from WordPress and going back to static sites that I code from scratch. I think WordPress is excessive for a lot of people's needs and want to help people move back to using static sites, when appropriate.

#### Using Python
I'd like to use Python to make tools/software for making art, music and writing (ie. datamoshing, abstract art, experimental stuff, etc.) Also, I would like to make automation tools and bots (not for spamming!) 

:floppy_disk: Another interest of mine is data archiving ("digital hoarding"). I want to learn web scraping using Python and write software/tools that aid in web scraping and archiving. So all-in-all, I'd like to focus on Python and become proficient at it. :floppy_disk: -->

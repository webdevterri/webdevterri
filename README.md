# Hello, World!
My name is Terri. I go by **webdevterri**.

I'm currently learning **Python** programming language through Udemy.

I'm an idea person.  :thought_balloon:  :thought_balloon:  :thought_balloon: I have tons of ideas (notebooks filled with ideas). I imagine working with others remotely through Github to create tools that others will find useful and enjoy.

### Goals & Interests:

#### Shopify
I started looking into Shopify theme developement and started learning Liquid. I need to learn JS. I'd like to make Shopify themes and eventually do custom themes for businesses/brands.

#### Using Python
I'd like to use programming to make tools/software for making art, music and writing (ie. datamoshing, abstract art, experimental stuff, etc.) Also, I would like to make automation tools and bots (not for spamming!) 

:floppy_disk: Another interest of mine is data archiving ("digital hoarding"). I want to learn web scraping using Python and write software/tools that aid in web scraping and archiving. So all-in-all, I'd like to focus on Python and become proficient at it. :floppy_disk:
